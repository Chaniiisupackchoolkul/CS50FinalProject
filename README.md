This project aims to develop an online quiz platform that allows students to test their knowledge in mathematics and English. The platform is designed to be reliable and efficient, using Python programming and Mathjax to ensure that mathematical equations are displayed beautifully and easy to read. The database of exam questions is divided into subjects and levels, providing tests for students of different age groups and skill levels.

## features
One of the key features of the platform is the immediate feedback provided to students upon completion of the quiz. The system displays the score and a breakdown of correct and incorrect answers, allowing students to see where they need improvement. Additionally, students are able to retake the quiz as many times as they'd like.

This project has the potential to help students improve their knowledge and skills in mathematics and English, providing a valuable resource for young students just starting out, as well as high school students preparing for exams.
